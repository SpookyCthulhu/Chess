Store board tiles in a hashtable.
Each chess piece stores a local copy of board as 'moves' with a bool indicating whether or not the piece can move there.
When determining valid king moves request the moves hashtable of each opposing teams pieces and check the board position you are trying to move to "moves[E6] == false".
